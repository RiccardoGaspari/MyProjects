# Bit Flip Computation IP Module

This project implements an IP module that computes the number of bit flips in a given input array. Designed with a modular architecture, it features a high-level hierarchy of sub-modules and a standardized BUS interface, making it easy to integrate into larger digital systems.

## Project Overview

- **IP Module Functionality:**  
  - Computes the number of bit flips (transitions from 0 to 1 or vice versa) in an input array.
  - Designed for efficient, high-speed processing.
- **Module Hierarchy:**  
  - Composed of multiple sub-modules (computation, control, and interface) to maintain clarity and modularity.
- **BUS Interface:**  
  - Implements a BUS interface for configuration, control, and status monitoring.
  - Facilitates communication with external systems and other IP blocks.
