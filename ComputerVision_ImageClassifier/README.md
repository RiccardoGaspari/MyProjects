# Cat Classification Models

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate cat image classification using different deep learning approaches:

- **CustomModel_cats.ipynb:**  
  A notebook that builds and trains a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) for cat classification from scratch. It includes data preprocessing, model design, training routines, and evaluation.

- **ResNet50_cats.ipynb:**  
  A notebook that leverages transfer learning using the pre-trained ResNet50 model to classify cat images. It outlines how to fine-tune a robust architecture for the cat classification task.
