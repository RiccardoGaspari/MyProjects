# VHDL Divider Project

This VHDL project implements two divider architectures: a combinational divider and a serial divider. The designs are compared based on their performance metrics, including latency, resource utilization, and overall efficiency. This project is ideal for those interested in digital design and VHDL-based system development.

## Project Overview

- **Combinational Divider:**  
  Implements division using parallel logic to provide fast results, at the cost of higher area usage.

- **Serial Divider:**  
  Implements division in a sequential manner, offering reduced area and power consumption, though at a slower speed.
