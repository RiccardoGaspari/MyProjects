# FSM Final Project

This LabVIEW project represents a project for a course in Electronic Engineering. It focuses on implementing a Finite State Machine to control and simulate various operational states. The design showcases the practical application of state-based logic using LabVIEW.

## Project Overview

- **Finite State Machine Implementation:** Demonstrates the design and operation of a FSM.
- **Simulation & Control:** Provides a user interface via the LabVIEW front panel to simulate state transitions and monitor outputs.
- **Educational Focus:** Illustrates fundamental principles of state-based control systems, useful for academic and industrial applications.ù
