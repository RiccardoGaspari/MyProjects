# CNN Models Training and Deployment on GAP9 Microcoprocessor

In this project, CNN models are trained using popular deep learning frameworks and then optimized for deployment on the GAP9 microcoprocessor. GAP9 is designed for low-power, high-performance edge computing. This repository covers the entire workflow—from model training and optimization to deployment and performance evaluation on GAP9.

## Project Overview

- **CNN Model Training:**  
  Code for training various CNN architectures using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

- **Model Optimization:**  
  Scripts and techniques for quantization and pruning to reduce the model’s memory footprint and improve inference speed on GAP9.

- **Deployment:**  
  Example code and instructions for deploying the optimized CNN models on the GAP9 microcoprocessor.

- **Performance Analysis:** 
  Benchmarking the model’s accuracy, inference latency, and resource usage before and after deployment.
