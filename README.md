## About

I am Riccardo Gaspari, a dedicated electronics engineer with a strong academic background and practical experience in designing and implementing innovative solutions. This repository is a curated showcase of my work, featuring various projects from my masterâ€™s coursework. These projects cover topics ranging from circuit design and simulation to advanced digital systems.

## Projects Overview

The repository includes:

- **LabVIEW Projects:** Finite State Machine (FSM) implementations and other control systems.
- **LTSpice Projects:** Analog circuit simulations such as multi-stage opamp designs.
- **CNN and GAP9 Deployment:** Deep learning model training and deployment on edge hardware.
- **SystemVerilog and VHDL Projects:** Digital design projects, including IP modules and divider designs, comparing different architectures and performance metrics.

Each project folder contains:

- **Source Code/Schematics:** The design files and code used in the project.
- **Documentation:** Detailed explanations, simulation results, and design rationales.
- **Testbenches/Simulations:** Tools and files to reproduce and validate the results.

## How to Navigate

- **Project Folders:**  
  Each project is organized into its own folder, labeled with a descriptive name (e.g., `LabVIEW_FSM`, `LTSpice_Opamp`, `CNN_GAP9`, `SystemVerilog_IP`, `VHDL_Divider`).

- **Documentation:**  
  Inside each folder, you'll find a README file or documentation files that explain the project objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.

- **Code and Schematics:**  
  The design files are provided in standard formats (e.g., `.vi` for LabVIEW, `.asc` for LTSpice, `.vhd`/`.sv` for VHDL/SystemVerilog, and Jupyter notebooks for CNN projects).

## Highlights

- **Diverse Skill Set:**  
  Projects span both analog and digital domains, showcasing a balance of theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.

- **Innovation & Problem-Solving:**  
  Each project demonstrates my approach to tackling real-world engineering challenges, from circuit optimization to efficient algorithm design.

- **Collaboration & Learning:**  
  This repository is a testament to my continuous learning process and my ability to collaborate on complex projects.

## Future Updates

I plan to continuously update this repository with new projects, improvements on existing ones, and additional documentation as I further refine my skills and work on new challenges.
