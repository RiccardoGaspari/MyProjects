# FSM Final Project

This LabVIEW project represents a project for a course in Electronic Engineering. The goal of the project is the study of a distance sensor, in order to replicate the V=f(distance) relationship given by datasheet and study the different behaviours of the sensors by changing the surface observed. The design showcases the practical application of state-based logic using LabVIEW.

## Project Overview

- **Finite State Machine Implementation:** Demonstrates the design and operation of a FSM.
- **Simulation & Control:** Provides a user interface via the LabVIEW front panel to simulate state transitions and monitor outputs.
